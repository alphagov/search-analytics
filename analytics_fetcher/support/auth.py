"""Handle authentication with google.

gapy and google's oauth2client are awkward to use without writing secrets files
to disk.  We want to be able to pass the secrets files in as environment
variables.  This code manages this by using a temporary directory to place the
secrets in, and serialising / unserialising the contents of this directory to a
base-64 encoded string.

This code is used in two situations; firstly for setting up the auth, and
secondly for creating an authenticated client for making requests to google.

For auth setup, simply call the `calc_env_var` function.  This performs the
oauth flow, and then returns the encoded value of the returned secrets.
The script in `scripts/setup_auth.py` performs this flow.

For creating a client, first make an AuthFileManager and enter its context.
Then call `AuthFileManager.from_env_var()` to populate it with the secrets.
Finally, call the `open_client` function, passing it the AuthFileManager, to
get an authenticated client.  The client will be valid until the
AuthFileManager context is exited.  ie, if the secrets had been passed in the
"GAAUTH" environment variable:

    with AuthFileManager() as afm:
        afm.from_env_var(os.environ["GAAUTH"])
        client = open_client(afm)
        # Use the client in this context

    avoid storing the secrets files on disk, where they may get accidentally
